# 9Day-100DaysOfPythonGPT-SecretAuction
Day 9 of the [100 Days of Code with Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) from Udemy.

## What is 100DaysOfPythonGPT?

100 Days of Python is a Python Bootcamp from Udemy that provides 100 days of Python pratical content with lessons and projects. The GPT part is something I'm adding to the course and infers that I shall use ChatGPT's engine and/or API in some way on each and every one of those 100 projects. Furthermore, I shall also practice using PyTest to test these projects and applications at least in some level.

## SecretAuction

Secret Auction is the ninth project of the ninth day of the bootcamp. Its purpose is to learn how to use dictionarys.

The program represents a secret auction, where a number of players give their names and a bid and, in the end, the program answers on the prompt with the winner of the auction.

Ther isn't much use for ChatGPT's API in this program, but I have created a test for finding the winner.

## Project Structure

 - [src/](src/) - The `secret_auction.py` file has the function to insert a player, the function to find the winner, the function to clear the console (the lambda one) and the main function to run everything;
 - [test/](test/) - The `test_secret_auction.py` file holds the test for the `find_winner` function.
